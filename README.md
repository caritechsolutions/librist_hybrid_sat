# libRIST

A library that can be used to easily add the RIST protocol to your application.

This code was written to comply with the Video Services Forum (VSF) Technical Recommendations TR-06-1 and TR-06-2. The protocol goes by the codename "RIST"

The canonical repository URL for this repo is https://code.videolan.org/rist/librist

This project is partially funded by the SipRadius LLC.

## Goal and Features

The goal of this project is to provide a RIST library for **most platforms**.

It supports all features from the TR-06-1 and most of the features of TR-06-2.

## Dependencies

None. This library has no external runtime dependencies on any OS other than normal core OS libraries.

## License

**libRIST** is released under a very liberal license, a contrario from the other VideoLAN projects, so that it can be embedded anywhere, including non-open-source software; or even drivers, to allow the creation of hybrid decoders.

The reasoning behind this decision is the same as for libvorbis, see [RMS on vorbis](https://lwn.net/2001/0301/a/rms-ov-license.php3).

## Library sweet spot (optimal use cases with current defaults)

- Buffer sizes from 50 ms to 30 seconds
- Networks with round trip times from 0ms to 5000ms
- Bitrates from 0 to 1 Gbps
- Packet size should be kept under the path's MTU (typically 1500). The library does not support packet fragmentation.
- Bi-directional communication available (not one-way systems like satellite)

If you have an application that needs to operate outside the sweet spot described above, you will need to modify some constants in the rist-private.h header and/or use some of the more obscure API calls to fine tune the library for your use case. The library can overcome all the limitations above by fine-tuning with the exception of packet fragmentation which will be addressed as a feature enhancement in the future.

# Roadmap

The plan is the following:

### Reached
1. Complete C implementation of the rist protocol,
2. Provide a usable API,

### On-going
3. Improve C code base with [various tweaks](https://code.videolan.org/rist/librist/wikis/to-do),
4. Port/test on most platforms
5. Provide wrappers for other languages

# Contribute

Currently, we are looking for help from:
- C developers,
- asm developers,
- platform-specific developers,
- testers.

Our contributions guidelines are quite strict. We want to build a coherent codebase to simplify maintenance and achieve the highest possible speed.

Notably, the codebase is in pure C and asm.

We are on Telegram, on the rist_users and librist_developers channels.

# VSF TR-06-4 Part 7 RIST Satellite-Hybrid Implementation

## Project Overview

This project implements the **VSF TR-06-4 Part 7 RIST Satellite-Hybrid: In-Band Method** specification within the libRIST library. The implementation provides a sophisticated hybrid satellite/internet distribution system where satellite serves as the primary unidirectional distribution channel, while RIST over internet provides seamless recovery of lost or corrupted data.

## Architecture

### Solution Design

The implementation follows the VSF TR-06-4 Part 7 solution architecture, creating a hybrid system that:

- Uses satellite as the primary content distribution method (unidirectional)
- Employs internet/RIST for recovering lost or corrupted data
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing legacy receivers
- Provides seamless failover between satellite and internet distribution
- Implements intelligent peer weight-based routing for optimal performance

### Key Components Implemented

**Upper Architecture (Recovery Server Side) - âœ… COMPLETE:**
- **Processing Tap**: Transport stream input processing
- **RTP Packetizer**: Creates RTP packets with 7 transport packets per RTP payload (SMPTE 2022-7 compliant)
- **Metadata Generator**: Framework for creating in-band synchronization data
- **Retransmission Buffer**: Buffers RTP stream for recovery requests
- **Recovery Server**: Handles Full Stream Request (FSR) signaling and retransmission requests

**Lower Architecture (Metadata Insertion) - ðŸ”„ PLANNED:**
- **Metadata Marker Generation**: In-band synchronization data creation
- **Transport Stream Multiplexing**: Metadata insertion into transport stream
- **PCR Restamping**: Algorithm for maintaining transport stream compliance
- **NULL Packet Management**: Bandwidth-efficient metadata insertion

## Peer Weight Architecture

### Satellite Peers (weight â‰  1000)
- **Primary distribution channel** via satellite
- **Continuously monitored** for health and availability
- **Single satellite peer** expected in normal operation
- **Automatic failover detection** based on peer death, timeouts, or high RTT

### Recovery Peers (weight = 1000)
- **Internet-based backup agents** for recovery operations
- **Conditionally activated** only when Full Stream Request (FSR) is enabled
- **Intelligent selection** by lowest RTT when multiple recovery agents exist
- **Bandwidth optimized** - only receive data when FSR is active
- **Dual purpose** - handle both NACK retransmissions and full stream recovery

## Full Stream Request (FSR) System

### Automatic Failover Logic

**FSR Enable Triggers:**
- Satellite peer marked as dead
- No packets from satellite peer for 2+ seconds
- High RTT (>500ms) indicating severe link degradation
- No satellite peer available (recovery-only mode)

**FSR Disable Triggers:**
- Satellite peer healthy (alive, recent packets within 1 second, RTT <200ms)
- Automatic recovery detection and seamless transition back to satellite

### Protocol Compliance

**RIST Simple Profile:**
- FSR Enable (Subtype 5) sent every 30 seconds as keepalive
- FSR Disable (Subtype 6) sent every 5 seconds until acknowledged
- Server timeout after 2 minutes without FSR enable messages

**RIST Advanced Profile:**
- FSR Enable (Control Index 0x0005) with same timing requirements
- FSR Disable (Control Index 0x0006) with proper tunnel control messaging
- Full compliance with TR-06-3 Advanced Profile specifications

## Intelligent NACK Routing

### Recovery-Agent-First Strategy
- **Priority routing** to weight-1000 recovery agents for all retransmission requests
- **RTT-based selection** when multiple recovery agents are available
- **Fallback mechanism** to standard peers if no recovery agents exist
- **Global coordination** between NACK processing and FSR management

## Implementation Details

### Core Protocol Extensions

**RTP Protocol Headers (`src/proto/rtp.h`):**
- Added FSR_SUBTYPE_ENABLE and FSR_SUBTYPE_DISABLE constants
- Extended RTCP message type definitions for Part 7 compliance

**FSR Management System (`src/udp.c`):**
- Implemented `add_to_fsr_list()` for dynamic peer tracking
- Implemented `remove_from_fsr_list()` for proper cleanup
- Created `peer_id_in_fsr_list()` for membership checking
- Added `has_fsr_requests()` for system state queries
- Modified weight-1000 peer data distribution logic for conditional activation

**RTCP Message Processing (`src/rist-common.c`):**
- Extended `rist_rtcp_recv()` to handle FSR Enable/Disable messages
- Added authentication and validation checks for FSR requests
- Implemented sender-side FSR processing with proper security controls
- Added FSR decision engine with satellite peer health monitoring

**Peer Lifecycle Management:**
- Modified `rist_timeout_check()` to include FSR cleanup on peer timeouts
- Extended `rist_peer_remove()` to prevent orphaned FSR entries
- Ensured thread-safe FSR list management across all peer operations

**NACK Processing Enhancement:**
- Modified `send_nack_group()` to implement recovery-agent-first routing
- Added global recovery agent coordination between NACK and FSR systems
- Implemented RTT-based selection for optimal recovery agent choice

### Security and Validation

**Authentication Controls:**
- FSR requests only processed from authenticated peers
- Sender-side validation prevents unauthorized FSR activation
- RIST packet identifier validation for message authenticity

**Message Validation:**
- Minimum packet size enforcement (12 bytes)
- RTCP message structure validation
- SSRC field handling for proper media source identification

### Thread Safety

**Concurrent Access Protection:**
- Thread-safe FSR peer list management using pthread mutex
- Global recovery agent coordination with proper locking
- Safe peer lifecycle management across multiple threads

## System Behavior

### Normal Operation (Satellite Healthy)
1. Satellite peer receives all primary data distribution
2. Recovery peers (weight-1000) remain inactive with no data flow
3. NACK requests intelligently routed to recovery agents when available
4. FSR system remains disabled with continuous satellite health monitoring

### Degraded Operation (Satellite Issues)
1. Automatic detection of satellite peer problems through health monitoring
2. FSR Enable message sent via selected recovery agent (lowest RTT)
3. Recovery peers activated to receive full stream data
4. Internet-based distribution provides seamless content continuation
5. Regular FSR Enable keepalives maintain recovery session

### Recovery Operation (Satellite Restored)
1. Automatic detection of satellite peer health restoration
2. FSR Disable message sent to gracefully terminate recovery mode
3. Recovery peers deactivated with immediate data flow cessation
4. Seamless transition back to satellite-only distribution
